# BookStore API - Professional Node.js Backend

## ðŸš€ **Technical Highlights for Resume**

### **Architecture & Design Patterns**
- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns with Controllers â†’ Services â†’ DAO â†’ Models
- **Repository Pattern**: Consistent data access layer with DAO implementation
- **Middleware Pattern**: Custom middleware for authentication, validation, caching
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling with custom AppError class

### **Advanced Features Implemented**

#### **1. Performance Optimization**
- **Caching Layer**: In-memory caching with TTL for frequently accessed data
- **Database Indexing**: Optimized MongoDB queries with compound indexes
- **Request Monitoring**: Real-time performance tracking and analytics
- **Memory Management**: Memory usage monitoring and leak detection

#### **2. Security Implementation**
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication with refresh tokens
- **Input Sanitization**: Protection against XSS and NoSQL injection attacks
- **Rate Limiting**: API rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **Password Hashing**: bcrypt with salt rounds for secure password storage
- **CORS Configuration**: Configurable cross-origin resource sharing

#### **3. API Features**
- **RESTful Design**: Standard HTTP methods and status codes
- **API Versioning**: `/api/v1/` prefix for backward compatibility
- **Advanced Filtering**: Query parameters for sorting, pagination, field selection
- **Search Functionality**: Full-text search with MongoDB text indexes
- **Response Standardization**: Consistent API response format

#### **4. Monitoring & Analytics**
- **Request Analytics**: Track API usage, response times, error rates
- **System Metrics**: Monitor memory usage, uptime, performance
- **Logging**: Structured logging with Winston for production debugging
- **Health Checks**: Comprehensive health monitoring endpoints

### **Technical Stack**
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **Authentication**: JWT with bcrypt password hashing
- **Validation**: Express-validator with custom middleware
- **Logging**: Winston for structured logging
- **Security**: Helmet, CORS, rate limiting, input sanitization

### **Key Interview Points**

#### **Scalability Considerations**
- Implemented caching to reduce database load
- Database connection pooling for concurrent requests
- Modular architecture for easy feature additions
- Stateless authentication for horizontal scaling

#### **Error Handling Strategy**
- Custom AppError class for operational errors
- Centralized error middleware with environment-specific responses
- Async error handling with higher-order functions
- Graceful shutdown handling for production

#### **Security Best Practices**
- Environment variable management for sensitive data
- Input validation and sanitization at multiple layers
- Secure password storage with bcrypt
- Rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks

#### **Code Quality**
- Consistent code structure and naming conventions
- JSDoc documentation for all functions
- Separation of business logic from HTTP concerns
- Reusable utility functions and middleware

### **Production Ready Features**
- Environment-specific configurations
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Database health checks
- Graceful error handling and recovery
- Performance optimization techniques
